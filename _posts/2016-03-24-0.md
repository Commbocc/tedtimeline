The Board of County Commissioners continued the discussion from March 9 regarding mobility fees on new development as part of a funding strategy for the Community Transportation Plan.

County staff presented a proposed phased implementation consisting of increased mobility fees over five years, phased buyback process for existing impact fee offsets over three years, and grandfathering of existing developer agreements for five years.
